# My Personal Project - A necessities manager
#### *Xutong Jiang*

## **Proposal**

Since the pandemic outbroke, people have been stuck in home for a long time. Sometimes, we may suddenly find that some 
necessities run out, and it may be hard to get them immediately, so a necessities' manager will be a big help to 
remind us current amount of necessities which should be typed in by users after each purchase, and what necessities will 
run out soon and thus make a purchase as soon as possible.

## **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to add, remove (no longer needed) necessities.
- As a user, I want to be able to add necessities' amount after purchase.
- As a user, I want to be able to set an estimation of average daily usage of each necessity and reduce their amount 
every time I refresh.
- As a user, I want to be able to check what necessities will run out recently (like 7 days).
- As a user, I would like to know how many days later one certain necessity is going to run out.
