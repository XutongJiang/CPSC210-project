# My Personal Project - A necessities manager
#### *Xutong Jiang*

## **Proposal**

Since the pandemic outbroke, people have been stuck in home for a long time. Sometimes, we may suddenly find that some 
necessities run out, and it may be hard to get them immediately, so a necessities' manager will be a big help to 
remind us current amount of necessities which should be typed in by users after each purchase, and what necessities will 
run out soon and thus make a purchase as soon as possible.

## **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to add, remove or modify necessities and their amount after each purchase. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the current list of necessities and remaining amount.
- As a user, I want to be able to set an estimation of average daily usage of each necessity and reduce their amount.
- As a user, I want to be able to receive alert when certain necessity is going to run out in a week.
- As a user, I want to be able to set the day of a week which I would usually go purchasing and get recommended purchase
time for each necessity.
