# My Personal Project - A necessities manager
#### *Xutong Jiang*

##**Proposal**

Since the pandemic outbroke, people have been stuck in home for a long time. Sometimes, we may suddenly find that some 
necessities run out and it may be hard to get them immediately, so a necessities' manager will be a big help to 
remind us current amount of necessities which should be typed in by users after each purchase, and what necessities will 
run out soon and thus make a purchase as soon as possible.
